> That’s why asking whether technology causes inequality is the wrong question. Instead, we should be asking how advancing technologies have changed the relative demand for high-skill and low-skill workers, and how well we are adapting to such changes.
>

> We are all centaurs now, our aesthetics continuously enhanced by computation. Every photograph I take on my smartphone is silently improved by algorithms the second after I take it. Every document autocorrected, every digital file optimised. Musicians complain about the death of competence in the wake of Auto-Tune , just as they did in the wake of the synthesiser in the 1970s.

> ?

> The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today.
> 
> J. C. R. Licklider, [Man-Computer Symbiosis](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html) (1960)





_There are two kinds of jobs now - jobs that you can do better with an AI assistant, and jobs that an AI assistant can do better than you._

[Scott Santens](https://medium.com/basic-income/deep-learning-is-going-to-teach-us-all-the-lesson-of-our-lives-jobs-are-for-machines-7c6442e37a49#.bi7y33b5m)

_IA, or Intelligence Augmentation, is all about empowering humans with tools that make them more capable and more intelligent, while traditional AI has been about removing humans fully from the loop._

_So, how do you find the best “+” for humans and AI?  How do you combine humans’ and AI’s individual strengths, to overcome their individual weaknesses?  Well, to do that, we first need to know exactly what humans’ and AI’s strengths and weaknesses are._

[Google’s A.I. Program Rattles Chinese Go Master as It Wins Match](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/business/google-alphago-defeats-go-ke-jie-again.html)

_Computer scientists say that often the best use of artificial intelligence is not to pit it against humans, but to pair it with them._ _To that end, two Go professionals, each teamed with AlphaGo, are scheduled to play against each other on Friday. Mr. Hassabis has said that top amateur Go players, with the help of AlphaGo, can generally manage to beat the software program in a match. In short, a human with a computer is still stronger than a computer._

**Tim O'Reilly** (July 2016)  
[Don’t Replace People. Augment Them.](https://medium.com/the-wtf-economy/dont-replace-people-augment-them-8bea60cb80ac)

_"Those weavers who smashed machine looms in Ned Ludd’s rebellion of 1811 didn’t realize that descendants of those machines would make unbelievable things possible. We’d tunnel through mountains and under the sea, we’d fly through the air, crossing continents in hours, we’d build cities in the desert with buildings a half mile high, we’d more than double average human lifespan, we’d put spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter, we’d smash the atom itself! What is impossible today, but will become possible with the technology we are now afraid of?_

**Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.** (November 2015)  
[Centaur Army: Bob Work, Robotics, & The Third Offset Strategy](http://breakingdefense.com/2015/11/centaur-army-bob-work-robotics-the-third-offset-strategy/)

_“Human-machine collaboration is allowing a machine to help humans make better decisions faster,” Work said at the Reagan Forum. “That is a big, big difference. There is an artificial intelligence (AI) bias right now generally in the community [i.e. using unmanned systems to replace humans, rather than augment them]. But…automated systems use algorithms based on old data, [and] we’re up against a thinking adversary that is changing strategies all the time.”_

**Alvin DMello** (October 2015)  
[Rise of the humans: intelligence amplification will make us as smart as the machines](http://theconversation.com/rise-of-the-humans-intelligence-amplification-will-make-us-as-smart-as-the-machines-44767)

_"In contrast to AI, which is a standalone system capable of processing information as well as or better than a human, IA is actually designed to complement and amplify human intelligence. IA has one big edge over AI: it builds on human intelligence that has evolved over millions of years, while AI attempts to build intelligence from scratch._

**The Economist** (May 2015)  
[The dawn of artificial intelligence](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21650543-powerful-computers-will-reshape-humanitys-future-how-ensure-promise-outweighs)

_"The best players in the world are not machines however, but what Garry Kasparov, a grandmaster, calls “centaurs”: amalgamated teams of humans and algorithms. Such collectives will become the norm in all sorts of pursuits: supported by AI, doctors will have a vastly augmented ability to spot cancers in medical images; speech-recognition algorithms running on smartphones will bring the internet to many millions of illiterate people in developing countries; digital assistants will suggest promising hypotheses for academic research; image-classification algorithms will allow wearable computers to layer useful information onto people’s views of the real world._

**Mike Cassidy** (December 2014)  
[Centaur Chess Shows Power of Teaming Human and Machine](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-cassidy/centaur-chess-shows-power_b_6383606.html)

_Yes centaur — and Kasparov was apparently the first. Rather than half-horse, half-human, a centaur chess player is one who plays the game by marrying human intuition, creativity and empathy with a computer’s brute-force ability to remember and calculate a staggering number of chess moves, countermoves and outcomes. The centaur story is an elegant example of the way visionaries see the optimal interplay between humans and machines. Teaming the two in chess, experts say, produces a force that plays better chess than either humans or computers can manage on their own._

**George Dvorsky** (May 2013)  
[Humans With Amplified Intelligence Could Be More Powerful Than AI](http://io9.gizmodo.com/humans-with-amplified-intelligence-could-be-more-powerf-509309984)

_The third step involves the genuine augmentation of pre-frontal cortex. This is the Holy Grail of IA research — enhancing the way we combine perceptual data to form concepts. The end result would be cognitive super-McGyvers, people who perform apparently impossible intellectual feats. For instance, mind controlling other people, beating the stock market, or designing inventions that change the world almost overnight._

**Garry Kasparov** (February 2010)  
[The Chess Master and the Computer](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/02/11/the-chess-master-and-the-computer/)

_In what Rasskin-Gutman explains as Moravec’s Paradox, in chess, as in so many things, what computers are good at is where humans are weak, and vice versa. This gave me an idea for an experiment. What if instead of human versus machine we played as partners? My brainchild saw the light of day in a match in 1998 in León, Spain, and we called it “Advanced Chess.” Each player had a PC at hand running the chess software of his choice during the game. The idea was to create the highest level of chess ever played, a synthesis of the best of man and machine._
