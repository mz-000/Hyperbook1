#### Experience

> Science fiction is a branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology.
> 
> Isaac Asimov

> I’ve come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:  
> 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.  
> 2. Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.  
> 3. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.
> 
> Douglas Adams

> Because humans live finite lives, all technological advances immediately feel banal to whatever generation inherits their benefits. Any advance can be appreciated only by the handful of people who happen to exist within the same time period of that specific technology’s introduction.

> When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive.

#### Decision-making

> Change has never happened this fast before, and it will never be this slow again.

> Graeme Wood

> Although technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions.
> 
> Melvin Kranzberg

> People think technology as an abstraction has some sort of intrinsic power, and it doesn’t. It has to be motivated by political power or cultural power or something else.  
>

> Robert C. Post

> We can decide slavery is not a good idea. We can decide that fairly applied laws, rather than nepotistic favoritism, is a good idea. We can outlaw certain punishments with treaties. We can encourage accountability with the invention of writing. We can consciously expand our circle of empathy. These are all inventions, products of our minds, as much as lightbulbs and telegraphs are.
> 
> Kevin Kelly

> But if history and economics teach us anything, it’s that we have absolutely no idea what happens next.

#### Futures

> It is the arrogance of every age to believe that yesterday was calm.
> 
> Tom Peters

> To do nothing, or to be timid in imagining the future, would mean being left behind.

> What the writers of modern science fiction invent today, you and I will do tomorrow.
> 
> JG Ballard
