Our cognitive control is really quite limited: we have a restricted ability to distribute, divide, and sustain attention; actively hold detailed information in mind; and concurrently manage or even rapidly switch between competing goals.

What distinguishes distractions from interruptions are your intentions about how you choose to manage them; either you attempt to ignore them and carry on with your original goal—distraction—or you engage in them as a simultaneous, secondary goal—interruption.

Our cognitive control abilities that are necessary for the enactment of our goals have not evolved to the same degree as the executive functions required for goal setting.

Interruptions are the other major source of goal interference. The difference from distractions is that interruptions happen when you make a decision to concurrently engage in more than one task at the same time, and even if you attempt to switch rapidly between them.

Goal interference occurs when you reach a decision to accomplish a specific goal (e.g., retrieve something from the refrigerator, complete a work assignment, engage in a conversation, drive your car) and something takes place to hinder the successful completion of that goal.

The true core of the change to our mental landscape is that we are experiencing an elevation of information itself to the level of the ultimate commodity.

The fact that ignoring is an active process is critical to understanding the Distracted Mind because it emphasizes that it takes resources to filter out what is irrelevant.

This notion is supported by findings that molecular and physiological mechanisms that originally developed in our brain to support food foraging for survival have now evolved in primates to include information foraging.

We engage in interference-inducing behaviors because, from an evolutionary perspective, we are merely acting in an optimal manner to satisfy our innate drive to seek information.

Several studies have reported that US adults and teenagers check their phone up to 150 times a day, or every six to seven minutes that they are awake.
