## Highlights
[[Unintended Consequences]]- As computing has become embedded in everything from our automobiles and our telephones to our financial markets, technological complexity has eclipsed our ability to comprehend it. ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=55))
- When something is so complicated that its behavior feels magical, we end up resorting to the terminology and solemnity of religion. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=85))
- My goal is to help each of us navigate a path between the two extremes of fear and awe, laying out an orientation toward our technologies that will allow us to make progress in how we approach them. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=96))
- this orientation involves, among other things, each of us thinking the way scientists do when examining the massive complexity of biology. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=100))
- We owe this overconfidence to an idea that many of us are ensorcelled by: the unlimited potential of the human mind. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=142))
- When this happens, you see certain characteristic behaviors, hallmarks of a complex system: small changes cascade through this network, feedback occurs in the complex system, and there is even a sensitive dependence on the initial state of this system. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=169))
- These complex systems are all around us, from the software in our cars to the computers found in our appliances to the infrastructure of our cities. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=179))
- Computer science and engineering have a term, kluge, for a cobbled-together, inelegant, and sometimes needlessly complicated solution to a problem. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=342))
- A kluge works, but it isn’t pretty. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0177AGQ4Y&location=343))
