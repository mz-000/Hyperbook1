As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage.

The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.

All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now? Numbers alone won’t tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business.

As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.

The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.

The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.

The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.





## Highlights
- if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=286))
- The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=318))
- As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=674))
- what important truth do very few people agree with you on? ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1058))
- Airbnb saw untapped supply and unaddressed demand where others saw nothing at all. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1176))
- So you might ask: are there any fields that matter but haven’t been standardized and institutionalized? ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1200))
- To anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it’s useful to distinguish between three concepts: • Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity? • Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis? • Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs? ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1265))
- Neither side questions the premise that better computers will necessarily replace human workers. But that premise is wrong: computers are complements for humans, not substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete. ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1626))
- 1. The Engineering Question Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 2. The Timing Question Is now the right time to start your particular business? 3. The Monopoly Question Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 4. The People Question Do you have the right team? 5. The Distribution Question Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 6. The Durability Question Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? 7. The Secret Question Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see? ([Location 1762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1762))
- Cleantech entrepreneurs’ thinking about markets was hopelessly confused. They would rhetorically shrink their market in order to seem differentiated, only to turn around and ask to be valued based on huge, supposedly lucrative markets. But you can’t dominate a submarket if it’s fictional, and huge markets are highly competitive, not highly attainable. ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1830))
- Great companies have secrets: specific reasons for success that other people don’t see. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1893))
