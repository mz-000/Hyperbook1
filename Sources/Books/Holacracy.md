## Highlights
- But trying to poke a hole in the model is harder than implementing it! ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=50))
- This industrial-age paradigm operates on a principle I call “predict and control”: they seek to achieve stability and success through up-front planning, centralized control, and preventing deviation. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=129))
- “You have the responsibility, and the authority, to deal with your own tensions.” ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=331))
- To facilitate clear and concrete role definitions, the Holacracy constitution defines a role as consisting of three specific elements: a “purpose” to express; possibly one or more “domains” to control; and a set of “accountabilities” to enact. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=616))
- The Holacracy constitution refers to these people as “partners” of the organization, whether they’re technically employees, contractors, business partners, or in some other legal relationship. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=800))
