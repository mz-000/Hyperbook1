## Highlights
- First, technology is a friend. It makes life easier, cleaner, and longer. Can anyone ask more of a friend? ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=55))
- Stated in the most dramatic terms, the accusation can be made that the uncontrolled growth of technology destroys the vital sources of our humanity. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=59))
- tools of our tools, ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=69))
- Every technology is both a burden and a blessing; not either-or, but this-and-that. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=90))

- This is, in short, an ancient and persistent piece of wisdom, perhaps most simply expressed in the old adage that, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Without being too literal, we may extend the truism: To a man with a pencil, everything looks like a list. To a man with a camera, everything looks like an image. To a man with a computer, everything looks like data. And to a man with a grade sheet, everything looks like a number.

- Gutenberg, for example, was by all accounts a devout Catholic who would have been horrified to hear that accursed heretic Luther describe printing as “God’s highest act of grace, whereby the business of the Gospel is driven forward.” ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=241))
- Now comes the computer, carrying anew the banner of private learning and individual problem-solving. Will the widespread use of computers in the classroom defeat once and for all the claims of communal speech? Will the computer raise egocentrism to the status of a virtue?

- If you remove the caterpillars from a given habitat, you are not left with the same environment minus caterpillars: you have a new environment, and you have reconstituted the conditions of survival; the same is true if you add caterpillars to an environment that has had none.
