Companies are now reaching a crossroad in their use of AI, which we define as systems that extend human capability by sensing, comprehending, acting, and learning.

Experimentation: actively observing for spots in processes to test AI and to learn and scale a reimagined process from the perspective of the missing middle.

This adaptive capability is being driven by real-time data rather than by an a priori sequence of steps.

Mindset: assuming a radically different approach toward business by reimagining work around the missing middle, wherein people improve AI and, in turn, smart machines give humans superpowers.

In essence, machines are doing what they do best: performing repetitive tasks, analyzing huge data sets, and handling routine cases. And humans are doing what they do best: resolving ambiguous information, exercising judgment in difficult cases, and dealing with dissatisfied customers. This kind of emerging symbiosis between man and machine is unlocking what we have called the third wave of business transformation.

AI systems are not wholesale replacing us; rather, they are amplifying our skills and collaborating with us to achieve productivity gains that have previously not been possible.

Skills: actively developing the eight “fusion skills” necessary for reimagining processes in the missing middle.

Now, the third wave involves adaptive processes.
