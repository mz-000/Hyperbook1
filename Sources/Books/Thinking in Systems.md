## Highlights
- Political leaders don’t cause recessions or economic booms. Ups and downs are inherent in the structure of the market economy. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=213))
- The flu virus does not attack you; you set up the conditions for it to flourish within you. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=220))
- We have built up intuitively, without analysis, often without words, a practical understanding of how these systems work, and how to work with them. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=232))
- A diverse system with multiple pathways and redundancies is more stable and less vulnerable to external shock than a uniform system with little diversity. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=247))
- And why you can be doing something that has always worked and suddenly discover, to your great disappointment, that your action no longer works. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=283))
- And why things so often happen much faster or slower than everyone thinks they will. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=283))
- You can see some things through the lens of the human eye, other things through the lens of a microscope, others through the lens of a telescope, and still others through the lens of systems theory. Everything seen through each kind of lens is actually there. Each way of seeing allows our knowledge of the wondrous world in which we live to become a little more complete.

- A system* is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. If you look at that definition closely for a minute, you can see that a system must consist of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=343))

- The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=413))

- Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=418))

- An important function of almost every system is to ensure its own perpetuation. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=424))
- system generally goes on being itself, changing only slowly if at all, even with complete substitutions of its elements—as long as its interconnections and purposes remain intact. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=450))

- The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=452))

- First the general one: The information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect future behavior; it can’t deliver the information, and so can’t have an impact fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback. A person in the system who makes a decision based on the feedback can’t change the behavior of the system that drove the current feedback; the decisions he or she makes will affect only future behavior. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=835))

- A stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop must have its goal set appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect that stock. Otherwise, the feedback process will fall short of or exceed the target for the stock. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=853))

- A systems analysis can test a number of scenarios to see what happens if the driving factors do different things. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=939))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- the answer to this second question is roughly yes, ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=955))

- Our knowledge of the world instructs us first of all that the world is greater than our knowledge of it. ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1578))
- You can’t navigate well in an interconnected, feedback-dominated world unless you take your eyes off short-term events and look for long term behavior and structure; unless you are aware of false boundaries and bounded rationality; unless you take into account limiting factors, nonlinearities and delays. ([Location 1603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1603))
- Nonlinearity means that the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules. ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1685))
- Everything, as they say, is connected to everything else, and not neatly. ([Location 1773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1773))
- Think how many arguments have to do with boundaries—national boundaries, trade boundaries, ethnic boundaries, boundaries between public and private responsibility, and boundaries between the rich and the poor, polluters and pollutees, people alive now and people who will come in the future. ([Location 1839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1839))
- There always will be limits to growth. They can be self-imposed. If they aren’t, they will be system-imposed. No physical entity can grow forever. ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1924))
- I believe we must learn to wait as we learn to create. We have to patiently sow the seeds, assiduously water the earth where they are sown and give the plants the time that is their own. One cannot fool a plant any more than one can fool history. ([Location 1933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1933))
- The world peeps, squawks, bangs, and thunders at many frequencies all at once. What is a significant delay depends—usually—on which set of frequencies you’re trying to understand. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1959))
- Since Adam Smith, it has been widely believed that the free, competitive market is one of these properly structured self-regulating systems. In some ways, it is. In other ways, obvious to anyone who is willing to look, it isn’t. A free market does allow producers and consumers, who have the best information about production opportunities and consumption choices, to make fairly uninhibited and locally rational decisions. But those decisions can’t, by themselves, correct the overall system’s tendency to create monopolies and undesirable side effects (externalities), to discriminate against the poor, or to overshoot its sustainable carrying capacity. ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2063))
- Boundaries are problem-dependent, evanescent, and messy; they are also necessary for organization and clarity. ([Location 2088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2088))
- The alternative to overpowering policy resistance is so counterintuitive that it’s usually unthinkable. Let go. Give up ineffective policies. Let the resources and energy spent on both enforcing and resisting be used for more constructive purposes. You won’t get your way with the system, but it won’t go as far in a bad direction as you think, because much of the action you were trying to correct was in response to your own action. ([Location 2149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2149))
- or the delay between the first successful test of a new technology and the time when that technology is installed throughout the economy; ([Location 2843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2843))
- A system with an unchecked reinforcing loop ultimately will destroy itself. That’s why there are so few of them. ([Location 2916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2916))
- There is a systematic tendency on the part of human beings to avoid accountability for their own decisions. ([Location 2958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2958))
- The ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience. ([Location 2989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2989))
- When you understand the power of system self-organization, you begin to understand why biologists worship biodiversity even more than economists worship technology. ([Location 3008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3008))
- Insistence on a single culture shuts down learning and cuts back resilience. Any system, biological, economic, or social, that gets so encrusted that it cannot self-evolve, a system that systematically scorns experimentation and wipes out the raw material of innovation, is doomed over the long term on this highly variable planet. ([Location 3017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3017))
- In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly, letting go and dancing with the system. ([Location 3108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3108))
- The future can’t be predicted, but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. ([Location 3179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3179))
- A great deal of responsibility was lost when rulers who declared war were no longer expected to lead the troops into battle. ([Location 3381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3381))
- It is much easier to talk about hate in public than to talk about love. ([Location 3474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3474))
