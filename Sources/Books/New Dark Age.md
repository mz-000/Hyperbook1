If philosophy is that fraction of human thought dealing with that which cannot be explained by the sciences, then systemic literacy is the thinking that deals with a world that is not computable, while acknowledging that it is irrevocably shaped and informed by computation.

Like an air control system mistaking a flock of birds for a fleet of bombers, software is unable to distinguish between its model of the world and reality – and, once conditioned, neither are we.

Reading a book, listening to music, researching and learning: these and many other activities are increasingly governed by algorithmic logics and policed by opaque and hidden computational processes. Culture is itself a code/space.

If we do not understand how complex technologies function, how systems of technologies interconnect, and how systems of systems interact, then we are powerless within them, and their potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and inhuman corporations.

A simply functional understanding of systems is insufficient; one needs to be able to think about histories and consequences too.

And so we find ourselves today connected to vast repositories of knowledge, and yet we have not learned to think. In fact, the opposite is true: that which was intended to enlighten the world in practice darkens it. The abundance of information and the plurality of worldviews now accessible to us through the internet are not producing a coherent consensus reality, but one riven by fundamentalist insistence on simplistic narratives, conspiracy theories, and post-factual politics.

Computational thinking is an extension of what others have called solutionism: the belief that any given problem can be solved by the application of computation.

Schmidt’s – and Google’s – worldview is one that is entirely predicated on the belief that making something visible makes it better, and that technology is the tool to make things visible. This view, which has come to dominate the world, is not only fundamentally wrong; it is actively dangerous, both globally and in the specific instance that Schmidt states.

Media reports and activists have called the Syrian conflict the first large-scale climate war of the twenty-first century, connecting climate directly to the vast numbers of refugees arriving in Europe.

What is needed is not new technology, but new metaphors: a metalanguage for describing the world that complex systems have wrought.
