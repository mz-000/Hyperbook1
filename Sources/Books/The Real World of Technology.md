Technology, like democracy, includes ideas and practices; it includes myths and various models of reality. And like democracy, technology changes the social and individual relationships between us. It has forced us to examine and redefine our notions of power and of accountability.

Technology is not the sum of the artifacts, of the wheels and gears, of the rails and electronic transmitters Technology is a system. It entails far more than its individual material components. Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset.

Technology also needs to be examined as an agent of power and control, and I will try to show how much modern technology drew from the prepared soil of the structures of traditional institutions, such as the church and the military.

Any tasks that require caring, whether for people or nature, any tasks that require immediate feedback and adjustment, are best done holistically. Such tasks cannot be planned, coordinated, and controlled the way prescriptive tasks must be.

It was only when I considered in detail — as a metallurgist — what such a production enterprise would entail, that the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I began to understand what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command.

While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage.

Just as prescriptive technologies have, in the real world of technology, overwhelmed holistic ones, so have production models now become almost the only pattern of guidance for public and private thought and action.

It is the strength of the scientific method that it provides a way to derive the general from the particular and then, in turn, allows general rules and laws to be applied to particular questions.

When work is organized as a sequence of separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager.

To a new generation, many of these changed relationships appear so normal, so inevitable, that they are taken as given and are not questioned.
