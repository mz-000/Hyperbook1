- Massive Transformative Purpose, or MTP—the higher, aspirational purpose of the organization. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OO8ZGC6&location=691))
- Martin Seligman, a leading expert on positive psychology, differentiates between three states of happiness: the pleasurable life (hedonistic, superficial), the good life (family and friends) and the meaningful life (finding purpose, transcending ego, working toward a higher good).

- “If you build communities and you do things in public,” he says, “you don’t have to find the right people, they find you.” ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OO8ZGC6&location=826))
- Machine Learning is the ability to accurately perform new, unseen tasks, built on known properties learned from training or historic data, and based on prediction. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OO8ZGC6&location=897))
- Deep Learning is a new and exciting subset of Machine Learning based on neural net technology. It allows a machine to discover new patterns without being exposed to any historical or training data. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OO8ZGC6&location=902))
- While work in the past was mostly focused on the importance of the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), the Emotional Quotient (EQ) and Spiritual Quotient (SQ) are now becoming increasingly important metrics as well.

- F = MA, ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OO8ZGC6&location=1572))
