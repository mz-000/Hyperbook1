# The Entrepreneurial State

From the Internet to biotech and even shale gas, the US State has been the key driver of innovation-led growth—willing to invest in the most uncertain phase of the innovation cycle and let business hop on for the easier ride down the way.

‘The important thing for Government is not to do things which individuals are doing already, and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things which at present are not done at all’.

The State’s role is not just to create knowledge through national labs and universities, but also to mobilize resources that allow knowledge and innovations to diffuse broadly across sectors of the economy.

The ‘green’ industry is still in its early stages: it is characterized by both market and technological uncertainty. It will not develop ‘naturally’ through market forces, in part because of embedded energy infrastructure but also because of a failure of markets to value sustainability or to punish waste and pollution.

First, it means empowering governments to envision a direction for technological change and invest in that direction.

Creating a symbiotic (more mutualistic) public-private innovation ecosystem thus requires new methods, metrics and indicators to evaluate public investments and their results.

Fourth, precisely because failure is part of the trial and error process of trying to push markets into new areas, it means figuring out ways for governments and taxpayers to reap some of the rewards from the upside, rather than just de-risking the downside.

This is why proposals for increasing the wealth tax as a way to curb inequality and generate cash for the State to invest in the innovation and economic process—such as put forth by the French economist Thomas Piketty—are not enough. Bolder and more creative proposals are needed.

However, the issues raised in this book present a different view: that an entrepreneurial State invests in areas that the private sector would not invest in even if it had the resources. And it is the courageous risk-taking visionary role of the State that has been ignored.

It is a popular error that bureaucracy is less flexible than private enterprise. It may be so in detail, but when large scale adaptations have to be made, central control is far more flexible. It may take two months to get an answer to a letter from a government department, but it takes twenty years for an industry under private enterprise to readjust itself to a fall in demand.
