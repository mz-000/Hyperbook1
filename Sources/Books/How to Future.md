Leadership must enable a culture that supports the freedom to think and plan in non-linear ways, and views uncertainty as a material to build with, not as a risk to be mitigated.

Futuring isn’t a once a year or a few times per quarter event; it’s an always-on way of thinking about what’s next, with a dimension of nimbleness and fluidity that can become more a behaviour than a system.

It takes a future, even a speculative, strange, uncanny or orthogonal one, to fill a vacuum, to expose and reduce uncertainty, to find new pathways towards opportunities and risks. Not doing is not knowing.

Anticipating the potential terrain of a future, and deciding on confident action on that basis, means contributing to the formation and shape of that terrain.

Future readiness has become a strategic imperative as more leaders recognize the extent to which they are operating in one of the most fluid, uncertain and complicated global environments in living memory.

Anxiety about the future is often driven more by feelings of incomplete or disordered knowledge than by what specifically lies ahead. This can create a negative feedback loop, limiting how much we take in, and giving us a tendency to outsource the process and definition to others – experts, brands, governments and so on.

Power is in the richness of the conversations and considerations of those engaged together in a future exploration, not inherent in the tools or methods themselves.

You can create a structure from the insights that emerge, map them in a way that makes sense to you, and prototype and share them as a way of engaging others to stress test them, then derive tangible decisions and realizations from them.

Good framing is also a research investment. It isn’t simply about setting boundaries and choosing practices, but can also indicate how various stakeholders feel about particular issues or uncertainties and can drive important considerations to the top, early in the process.

What’s needed is a practice that enables the capacity to constructively sense-change – tuning into the signals that usefully inform our dynamic picture of the present and point to the continuation, shift or evolution of trends, forces and conditions over time.
