## Highlights
- Indeed, relying on the forecasts of many readers of this book may prove quite reasonable, for it turns out that forecasting is not a “you have it or you don’t” talent. It is a skill that can be cultivated. This book will show you how. ([Location 118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=118))
- I believe it is possible to see into the future, at least in some situations and to some extent, and that any intelligent, open-minded, and hardworking person can cultivate the requisite skills. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=155))
- Of course each of these pockets of predictability can be abruptly punctured. A good restaurant is very likely to open its doors when it says it will, but it may not, for any number of reasons, from a manager sleeping late, to fire, bankruptcy, pandemic, nuclear war, or a physics experiment accidentally creating a black hole that sucks up the solar system. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=249))
- In fact, in science, the best evidence that a hypothesis is true is often an experiment designed to prove the hypothesis is false, but which fails to do so. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=664))
- Anyone who has spent time around humans knows that. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=706))
- Whether intuition generates delusion or insight depends on whether you work in a world full of valid cues you can unconsciously register for future use. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=738))
- If we are serious about measuring and improving, this won’t do. Forecasts must have clearly defined terms and timelines. They must use numbers. And one more thing is essential: we must have lots of forecasts. ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1012))
- In effect, Brier scores measure the distance between what you forecast and what actually happened. So Brier scores are like golf scores: lower is better. Perfection is 0. A hedged fifty-fifty call, or random guessing in the aggregate, will produce a Brier score of 0.5. A forecast that is wrong to the greatest possible extent—saying there is a 100% chance that something will happen and it doesn’t, every time—scores a disastrous 2.0, as far from The Truth as it is possible to get.17 ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1061))
- (The average was forty-three.) ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1101))
- James Surowiecki’s bestseller The Wisdom of Crowds. ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1194))
- Aggregating the judgment of many consistently beats the accuracy of the average member of the group, and is often as startlingly accurate as Galton’s weight-guessers. The collective judgment isn’t always more accurate than any individual guess, however. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1195))
- Aggregating the judgments of people who know a little is better, and if there are enough of them, it can produce impressive results, but aggregating the judgments of an equal number of people who know lots about lots of different things is most effective because the collective pool of information becomes much bigger. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1211))
- There are two types of people in the world: those who think there are two types and those who don’t. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1298))
- Randomness is invisible from the tip-of-your-nose perspective. We can only see it if we step outside ourselves. ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1566))
- “Need for cognition” is the psychological term for the tendency to engage in and enjoy hard mental slogs. People high in need for cognition are the sort who like crosswords and Sudoku puzzles, the harder, the better—and superforecasters score high in need-for-cognition tests. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=1997))
- An awareness of irreducible uncertainty is the core of probabilistic thinking, but it’s a tricky thing to measure. ([Location 2279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=2279))
- Snow building up on the side of a mountain may slip and start an avalanche, or it may not. Until it happens, or it doesn’t, it could go either way. It is not predetermined by God or fate or anything else. It is not “meant to be.” It has no meaning. “Maybe” suggests that, contra Einstein, God does play dice with the cosmos. Thus, probabilistic thinking and divine-order thinking are in tension. Like oil and water, chance and fate do not mix. And to the extent that we allow our thoughts to move in the direction of fate, we undermine our ability to think probabilistically. ([Location 2363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=2363))
- So finding meaning in events is positively correlated with wellbeing but negatively correlated with foresight. That sets up a depressing possibility: Is misery the price of accuracy? ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=2423))
- So there are two dangers a forecaster faces after making the initial call. One is not giving enough weight to new information. That’s underreaction. The other danger is overreacting to new information, seeing it as more meaningful than it is, and adjusting a forecast too radically. ([Location 2516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=2516))
- Social psychologists have long known that getting people to publicly commit to a belief is a great way to freeze it in place, making it resistant to change. The stronger the commitment, the greater the resistance. ([Location 2564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=2564))
- For Keynes, failure was an opportunity to learn—to identify mistakes, spot new alternatives, and try again. ([Location 2805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=2805))
- Try, fail, analyze, adjust, try again: Keynes cycled through those steps ceaselessly. ([Location 2815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=2815))
- nothing can be accomplished without the belief that it can be. ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3344))
- In private, Eisenhower could be a moody, brooding chain-smoker. With the troops, he always had a smile and a steady word. ([Location 3496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3496))
- “Have backbone; disagree and commit” ([Location 3568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3568))
- The humility required for good judgment is not self-doubt—the sense that you are untalented, unintelligent, or unworthy. It is intellectual humility. It is a recognition that reality is profoundly complex, that seeing things clearly is a constant struggle, when it can be done at all, and that human judgment must therefore be riddled with mistakes. This is true for fools and geniuses alike. So it’s quite possible to think highly of yourself and be intellectually humble. ([Location 3613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3613))
- “Plans are useless,” Eisenhower said about preparing for battle, “but planning is indispensable.” ([Location 3845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3845))
- Knowing what we don’t know is better than thinking we know what we don’t. ([Location 3861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3861))
- But if you are as mathematically inclined as Taleb, you get used to the idea that the world we live in is but one that emerged, quasi-randomly, from a vast population of once-possible worlds. ([Location 3906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3906))
- The past did not have to unfold as it did, the present did not have to be what it is, and the future is wide open. ([Location 3907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3907))
- On the other hand, our expectations of the future are derived from our mental models of how the world works, and every event is an opportunity to learn and improve those models. ([Location 3950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=3950))
- It follows that the goal of forecasting is not to see what’s coming. It is to advance the interests of the forecaster and the forecaster’s tribe. ([Location 4000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=4000))
- As Wieseltier poetically put it, “Where wisdom once was, quantification will now be.” ([Location 4099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKO6MS8&location=4099))
- But there’s a much bigger collaboration I’d like to see. It would be the Holy Grail of my research program: using forecasting tournaments to depolarize unnecessarily polarized policy debates and make us collectively smarter.
