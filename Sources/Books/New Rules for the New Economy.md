Because communication—which in the end is what the digital technology and media are all about—is not just a sector of the economy. Communication is the economy.

The key premise of this book is that the principles governing the world of the soft—the world of intangibles, of media, of software, and of services—will soon command the world of the hard—the world of reality, of atoms, of objects, of steel and oil, and the hard work done by the sweat of brows.

The dynamic of our society, and particularly our new economy, will increasingly obey the logic of networks. Understanding how networks work will be the key to understanding how the economy works.

Without some element of governance from the top, bottom-up control will freeze when options are many. Without some element of leadership, the many at the bottom will be paralyzed with choices.

We are headed into an era when both workers and consumers will feel more loyalty to a network than to any ordinary firm.

We are about to witness an explosion of entities built on relationships and technology that will rival the early days of life on Earth in their variety.

Ever since Gutenberg made the first commodity—cheaply duplicated words—we have realized that intangible things can easily be copied. This lowers the value per copy. What becomes valuable is the relationships—sparked by the copies—that tangle up in the network itself. The relationships rocket upward in value as the parts increase in number even slightly.

The new economy is about communication, deep and wide. All the transformations suggested in this book stem from the fundamental way we are revolutionizing communications. Communication is the foundation of society, of our culture, of our humanity, of our own individual identity, and of all economic systems. This is why networks are such a big deal.

This new economy has three distinguishing characteristics: It is global. It favors intangible things—ideas, information, and relationships. And it is intensely interlinked.

As tremendous as the influence of financial inventions have been, the influence of network inventions will be as great, or greater.
