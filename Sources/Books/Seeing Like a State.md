- The metaphorical value of this brief account of scientific production forestry is that it illustrates the dangers of dismembering an exceptionally complex and poorly understood set of relations and processes in order to isolate a single element of instrumental value. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D8JJYWA&location=473))
- Whereas artisanal products were typically made by a single producer according to the desires of a particular customer and carried a price specific to that object, the mass-produced commodity is made by no one in particular and is intended for any purchaser at all.

- high modernism ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D8JJYWA&location=1833))
