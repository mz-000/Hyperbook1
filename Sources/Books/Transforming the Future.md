## Highlights
- anticipatory systems theory proposes the potential existence of different kinds of future, sparking the search for methods to detect these largely unimagined and invisible elements of the world around us. Both are quintessential scientific endeavours (Schneider, 2012), ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=468))
- Hunting for different kinds of futures runs directly into the obstacle that by definition the future cannot exist in the present, since if it did it would no longer be the future but the present. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=473))
- The future does not exist in the present but anticipation does. The form the future takes in the present is anticipation. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=477))
- The FLF does this by providing a descriptive mapping of the ontological and epistemological attributes of anticipatory activities as specific anticipatory assumptions (AA). ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=507))
- Rather the task when describing FL is to reveal the anticipatory assumptions (AA) that determine why and how futures are imagined. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=560))
- the power of FL to overcome poverty of the imagination, ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=646))
- The gist is a dual hypothesis: first, that being futures literate improves the ability of people to sense and make-sense of novelty, including the richness of ephemeral time-space unique phenomena; and second, that this enhanced ability to appreciate, even cultivate complexity, for instance as ‘ontological expansion’ (Tuomi, 2017), might enable humans to adopt strategies intended to improve our prospects for resilience as a species by using the gift of human agency in ways that are more balanced between planning and creative spontaneity, between continuity based insurance of risk and diversification that embraces uncertainty. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=662))
- Futures Literacy (FL) is a capability. A futures literate person has acquired the skills needed to decide why and how to use their imagination to introduce the non-existent future into the present. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CPVD4MQ&location=776))
