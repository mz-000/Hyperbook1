## Highlights
- “The basic difference between an ordinary man and a warrior is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge while an ordinary man takes everything either as a blessing or a curse,” ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=48))
- Rather than maintaining its specialness, representing the unique skill the technician possesses and upon which he started the business, the work becomes trivialized, something to get through in order to make room for everything else that must be done. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=288))
- Jean Vaysse Toward Awakening ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=301))
- The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present. He’s happiest when left free to construct images of “what-if” and “if-when.” ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=363))
- Given his need for change, The Entrepreneur creates a great deal of havoc around him, which is predictably unsettling for those he enlists in his projects. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=371))
- You believe that a business is nothing more than an aggregate of the various types of work done in it, when in fact it is much more than that. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=552))
- If your business depends on you, you don’t own a business—you have a job. And it’s the worst job in the world because you’re working for a lunatic! ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=577))
- “The purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can create jobs for other people. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=579))
- You can’t ignore the financial accountabilities, the marketing accountabilities, the sales and administrative accountabilities. You can’t ignore your future employees’ need for leadership, for purpose, for responsible management, for effective communication, for something more than just a job in which their sole purpose is to support you doing your job.
