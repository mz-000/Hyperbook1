## Highlights
- Google workers are less the beneficiaries of an expanding company than they are its rapidly consumed resources. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Z8VTKBQ&location=74))
- It’s grow or die. So each tech company must become as intrusive, extractive, divisive, time-consuming, wasteful, expensive, job killing, exploitative, and manipulative as the next one. ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Z8VTKBQ&location=94))
- we are running an extractive, growth-driven economic operating system that has reached the limits of its ability to serve anyone, rich or poor, human or corporate. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Z8VTKBQ&location=108))
- From the company’s side, it’s simply a cost-saving measure. After an initial technological investment, they can dispense with the operators, as well as the paychecks, health benefits, air-conditioning, sexual harassment suits, and other costs associated with human employees. Reducing the bottom line is a great way to create the illusion of top-line growth. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Z8VTKBQ&location=243))
