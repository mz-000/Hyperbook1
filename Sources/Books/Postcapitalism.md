## Highlights
- Money is created by states and always has been; it is not something that exists independently of governments. Money is always the ‘promise to pay’ by a government. Its value is not reliant on the intrinsic worth of a metal; it is a measure of people’s trust in the permanence of the state.

- happens – in systems terminology – at the ‘meso’ level, between micro- and macro-economics. Its scale locates it somewhere between the credit cycle and the doom of the entire system. ([Location 1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=1541))
- Kondratieff Wave ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=1574))
- With information, part of the product remains with the worker in a way it did not during the industrial era. ([Location 2622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2622))
- Cognitive capitalism, say its proponents, is a coherent new form of capitalism: a ‘third capitalism’, following the merchant capitalism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the industrial capitalism of the last 200 years. It is based on global markets, financialized consumption, immaterial labour and immaterial capital. ([Location 2699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2699))
- We are no longer in a world of clearly delineated production and consumption, but one in which ideas, behaviours and customer interactions with the brand are critical to generating profit; production and consumption are blurred. ([Location 2721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2721))
- Jeremy Rifkin, an influential management consultant, came closest to describing current reality in his 2014 book The Zero Marginal Cost Society.53 Rifkin argues that peer-production and capitalism are two different systems; currently they coexist and even gain energy from each other, but ultimately peer-production will reduce the capitalist sector of the economy to a few niches. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2745))
- The proliferation of these non-market economic activities is making it possible for a cooperative, socially just society to emerge. ([Location 2787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2787))
- Technologically, we are headed for zero-price goods, unmeasurable work, an exponential takeoff in productivity and the extensive automation of physical processes. ([Location 2794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2794))
- Today, the main contradiction in modern capitalism is between the possibility of free, abundant socially produced goods, and a system of monopolies, banks and governments struggling to maintain control over power and information. That is, everything is pervaded by a fight between network and hierarchy. ([Location 2796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2796))
- So we have to design the transition to postcapitalism. ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2811))
- Just listen to any politician make a speech about welfare: cutting unemployment and disability benefits is designed to force people to take jobs at wages they can’t live on. In no other aspect of the market does the government coerce us to take part; nobody says ‘You must go ice skating or society will collapse.’ ([Location 2975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2975))
- labour-theory is ‘metaphysical’ – a mental construct whose existence could never be disproved. ([Location 2998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=2998))
- Innovation, which is driven by the need to minimize costs, maximize output and utilize resources, does bring rising material wealth. ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=3075))
- And that was how all crises looked in the era of scarcity: mass unemployment and idle plant caused by a collapse in profitability, and all explicable using the labour theory of value. ([Location 3084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=3084))
- The cost of printing one million transistors on to a piece of silicon has fallen from a dollar to 6 cents in ten years. Over roughly the same period, the cost of one gigabyte of storage has fallen from a dollar to 3 cents; and the cost of a one megabit broadband connection has fallen from $1,000 in the year 2000 to $23 today. ([Location 3187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=3187))
- An economy based on information, with its tendency to zero-cost products and weak property rights, cannot be a capitalist economy. ([Location 3389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=3389))
- As in nature – and as in dialectical logic – the end is usually a moment of ‘sublation’, a concept that combines the simultaneous destruction of something and its survival as something else. ([Location 3449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=3449))
- ‘reproductive technology shock’. ([Location 3902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=3902))
- ‘The conditions of time in the new capitalism have created a conflict between character and experience, the experience of disjointed time threatening the ability of people to form their characters into sustained narratives.’ ([Location 4034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4034))
- In many industrial and commercial cities around the world, the networked individual is no longer a sociological curiosity, s/he is the archetype. ([Location 4055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4055))
- Above their heads, politics in many countries has become infested by a kleptocratic mafia, whose strategy is to deliver growth at the price of suppressing freedom and expanding inequality. ([Location 4088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4088))
- information goods whose marginal production cost is zero. ([Location 4346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4346))
- Printing transformed the way human beings think. ([Location 4528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4528))
- The philosopher Francis Bacon wrote in 1620 that printing, gunpowder and the compass ‘have changed the whole face and state of things throughout the world’.33 ([Location 4529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4529))
- The internet, says French economist Yann Moulier-Boutang, is ‘both the ship and the ocean’ for the modern-day conquest of a new world. In fact, it is the ship, the compass, the ocean and the gold. ([Location 4580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4580))
- Its aim should be to expand those technologies, business models and behaviours that dissolve market forces, eradicate the need for work and progress the world economy towards abundance. ([Location 4587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4587))
- Wherever I go, I ask questions about economics – and get answers about climate. ([Location 4612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4612))
- There’s a pointless argument between economists and ecologists over which crisis is more important – the ecosphere or the economy? The materialist answer is that their fates are interlinked. ([Location 4623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4623))
- In the world of suits and climate summits, a complacent calm rules. The focus is on scenarios for ‘what will happen’, ([Location 4626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4626))
- Climate change does not present us with a choice of market or non-market routes to meeting carbon targets. It mandates either the orderly replacement of market economics or its disorderly collapse in abrupt phases. ([Location 4887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4887))
- If you used the method engineers use – root cause analysis – to ask why three systemic disruptions are happening at once (financial, climatic and demographic), you would quickly trace them to their cause: an economic system in disequilibrium with its environment and insufficient to satisfy the needs of a rapidly changing humanity. ([Location 4935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=4935))
- Peer-to-peer projects, collaborative business models and non-profit activities are typically small scale and fragile. ([Location 5155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5155))
- At the government level, there could be an Office of the Non-Market Economy, tasked to nurture all businesses where free stuff is produced, or where sharing and collaboration are essential, and maximizing the amount of economic activity that takes place beyond the price system. ([Location 5197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5197))
- It may sound radical to outlaw certain business models, but that’s what happened with slavery and with child labour. ([Location 5213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5213))
- Our aim would be to regularize postcapitalism: to privilege the free wifi network in the mountain village over the rights of the telecoms monopoly. Out of such tiny changes, new systems can grow. ([Location 5215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5215))
- In the short term, the intention is not to reduce complexity – as the money fundamentalists want – nor simply to stabilize banking, but to promote the most complex form of capitalist finance compatible with progressing the economy towards high automation, low work and abundant cheap or free goods and services. ([Location 5324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5324))
- The effect would be to socialize the costs of automation. ([Location 5339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5339))
- In many industries old disciplines of work – time, obedience, attendance, hierarchy – are enforced only because neoliberalism is suppressing innovation. But they are technologically unnecessary. ([Location 5388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5388))
- Let’s spell out what this means: cooperative, self-managed, non-hierarchical teams are the most technologically advanced form of work. ([Location 5393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5393))
- Beneath it all lies lingering doubt. Their self-belief tells them that capitalism is good because it is dynamic – but its dynamism is only really felt where there are plentiful supplies of cheap labour, repressed democracy – and where inequality is rising. ([Location 5462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5462))
- Postcapitalism will set you free. ([Location 5476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011I42XQ0&location=5476))
