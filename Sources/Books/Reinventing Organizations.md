## Highlights
- Where all the previous stages (Magic, Mythic, Rational, and Pluralistic) had operated out of a sense of lack, scarcity, and deficiency, this new level—which various researchers began calling “integrated,” “integral,” “autonomous,” “second tier,” “inclusive,” “systemic”—acted out of a sense of radical abundance, as if it were overflowing with goodness, truth, and beauty.

- (The Postmodernists utterly fail to distinguish between dominator hierarchies, which are indeed nasty, and actualization hierarchies, which are the primary form of natural growth, development, and evolution in the world—atoms to molecules to cells to organisms, for example. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICS9VI4&location=260))
- If we accept that there is a direction to human evolution, then we hold here something rather extraordinary: the blueprint of the future of organizations, the blueprint to the future of work itself. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICS9VI4&location=437))
- If there are barriers inside the organization, there is a moat between the organization and the outside world. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICS9VI4&location=696))
- In Orange, we effectively live in the future, consumed by mental chatter about the things we need to do so as to reach the goals we have set for ourselves. We hardly ever make it back to the present moment, where we can appreciate the gifts and freedom the shift to Orange has brought us.

- We have reached a stage where we often pursue growth for growth’s sake, a condition that in medical terminology would simply be called cancer. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICS9VI4&location=840))
- According to the research, the trigger for vertical growth always comes in the form of a major life challenge that cannot be resolved from the current worldview. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICS9VI4&location=1030))
- What determines which stage an organization operates from? It is the stage through which its leadership tends to look at the world. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICS9VI4&location=1068))
