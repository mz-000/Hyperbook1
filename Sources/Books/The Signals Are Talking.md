A trend is driven by a basic human need, one that is catalyzed by new technology.

A trend, therefore, is a new manifestation of sustained change within an industry, the public sector, or society, or in the way that we behave toward one another. A trend is a starting point that helps us to simultaneously meet the demands of the present while planning for the future. In a sense, trends are the analogy our minds need to help us think about and understand change.

Unencumbered by the need to prove immediate success, to meet a bottom line, or to show a positive return on investment, fringe thinkers can push the boundaries of their imaginations without having to worry about process—that is, how to turn that dream into reality.

Pressure-Test Your Action: But what if the action you choose to take on a trend is the wrong one? In this final step, you must make sure the strategy you take on a trend will deliver the desired outcome, and that requires asking difficult questions about both the present and the future.

Fundamentally, a trend leverages our basic human needs and desires in a meaningful way and aligns human nature with emerging technologies and breakthrough inventions.

Organizations that can see trends early enough to take action have first-mover influence. But they can also help to inform and shape the broader context, conversing and collaborating with those in other fields to plan ahead.

THE FIRST STEP of forecasting the future requires a trip to the fringes of science, technology, design, and society, to where unusual experimentation is taking place. For it’s at the fringe that all trends are born.

Ask the Right Questions: Determine whether a pattern really is a trend. You will be tempted to stop looking once you’ve spotted a pattern, but you will soon learn that creating counterarguments is an essential part of the forecasting process, even though most forecasters never force themselves to poke holes into every single assumption and assertion they make.

In order to work out what Google is doing—why it would make a car, Google Glass, and so on, we need to Kanizsize the facts we’ve collected at the fringe.

Use CIPHER: Uncover hidden patterns by categorizing data from the fringe. Patterns indicate a trend, so you’ll do an exhaustive search for Contradictions, Inflections, Practices, Hacks, Extremes, and Rarities.
