## Highlights
- Two decades is a sweet spot for prognosticators of radical change: near enough to be attention-grabbing and relevant, yet far enough to make it possible to suppose that a string of breakthroughs, currently only vaguely imaginable, might by then have occurred.

- Contrast this with shorter timescales: most technologies that will have a big impact on the world in five or ten years from now are already in limited use, while technologies that will reshape the world in less than fifteen years probably exist as laboratory prototypes. Twenty years may also be close to the typical duration remaining of a forecaster’s career, bounding the reputational risk of a bold prediction.

- These achievements might not seem impressive today. But this is because our standards for what is impressive keep adapting to the advances being made. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LOOCGB2&location=474))
