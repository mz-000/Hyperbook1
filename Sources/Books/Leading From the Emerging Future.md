## Highlights
- It requires us to suspend our judgments, redirect our attention, let go of the past, lean into the future that wants to emerge through us, and let it come. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D498U6U&location=74))
- The systems operate through delayed or broken feedback loops that prevent decision-makers from experiencing and personally feeling the impact of their decisions. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D498U6U&location=143))
- Externality is a term that is used in economics to designate unintended side effects on third parties or costs that are not accounted for in prices. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D498U6U&location=149))
- Externalities can be positive (benefits) or negative (costs). For example, I may enjoy driving my car, but, unlike the cyclist behind me, I rarely notice the negative externality—air pollution—that I cause. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D498U6U&location=150))
