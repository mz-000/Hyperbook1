## Highlights
- But the ARPAnet did something else as well. Its electronic highways brought together hackers all over the U.S. in a critical mass; instead of remaining in isolated small groups each developing their own ephemeral local cultures, they discovered (or re-invented) themselves as a networked tribe.

- The most important feature of Linux, however, was not technical but sociological. Until the Linux development, everyone believed that any software as complex as an operating system had to be developed in a carefully coordinated way by a relatively small, tightly-knit group of people.

- An important trait of the great ones is constructive laziness. They know that you get an A not for effort but for results, and that it’s almost always easier to start from a good partial solution than from nothing at all.

- If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=430))
- Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=612))
- Interestingly enough, you will quickly find that if you are completely and self-deprecatingly truthful about how much you owe other people, the world at large will treat you as though you did every bit of the invention yourself and are just being becomingly modest about your innate genius. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=650))
- Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=659))
- When your development mode is rapidly iterative, development and enhancement may become special cases of debugging — fixing “bugs of omission” in the original capabilities or concept of the software. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=686))
- I think you can’t really aim or plan for a result like this. You have to get pulled into it by design ideas so powerful that afterward the results just seem inevitable, natural, even foreordained. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=698))
- Your nascent developer community needs to have something runnable and testable to play with. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=768))
- To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you. ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3LM&location=805))
