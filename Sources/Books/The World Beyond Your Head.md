## Highlights
- Human experience has become a highly engineered and therefore manipulable thing. ([Location 32](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=32))
- Capitalism has gotten hip to the fact that for all our talk of an information economy, what we really have is an attentional economy, if the term “economy” applies to what is scarce and therefore valuable. ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=57))
- The downside is that as autonomous individuals, we often find ourselves isolated in a fog of choices. Our mental lives become shapeless, and more susceptible to whatever presents itself out of the ether. ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=93))
- An ethics of attention would have to begin by taking seriously, and trying to make sense of, the qualitative character of first-person experience in our contemporary cognitive environment: by turns anxious, put-upon, distracted, exhausted, enthralled, ecstatic, self-forgetting. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=127))
- It has been said (by Iris Murdoch) that man is the animal that makes pictures of himself, and then comes to resemble the pictures. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=131))
- Attention is the thing that is most one’s own: in the normal course of things, we choose what to pay attention to, and in a very real sense this determines what is real for us; what is actually present to our consciousness. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=223))
- Distractibility might be regarded as the mental equivalent of obesity. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=280))
- To continue to insist that preferences express the sovereign self and are for that reason sacred—unavailable for rational scrutiny—is to put one’s head in the sand. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=305))
- A jig reduces the degrees of freedom that are afforded by the environment. It stabilizes a process, and in doing so lightens the burden of care—on both memory and fine muscular control. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=480))
- There is a large literature that shows that, for example, we consistently underestimate how long it will take us to get things done, no matter how many times we have been surprised by this same fact in the past (the so-called planning fallacy). ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=561))
- We give undue weight to the most recent events when trying to grasp a larger pattern and predict the future. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=563))
- Some indication of how well we are bearing this burden can be found in the fact that we are now very fat, very much in debt, and very prone to divorce. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=660))
- I went seven or eight years without filing a tax return, not out of a determination to avoid taxes, but simply due to the soul-crushing paralysis that would come over me at the thought of facing an impenetrable morass of tax instructions, and my own negligence in keeping records. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=664))

- Roboticists are learning a lesson that evolution learned long ago, namely, that the task of solving problems needn’t be accomplished solely by the brain, but can be distributed among the brain, the body, and the world. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=799))
- Stereotyping is efficient for snap judgments.) ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=944))
- unobtrusive masterpiece, ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=980))
- watching tutorials on YouTube. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1004))
- For experiences to become part of the secure, sedimented foundation of a skill, they must be criticized. Other people (and the resources of language) are indispensable. Without them, your experiences are partial, and may sediment as idiosyncratic bad habits. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1019))
- Getting things right requires triangulating with other people. Psychologists therefore would do well to ask whether “metacognition” (thinking critically about your own thinking) is at bottom a social phenomenon. It typically happens in conversation—not idle chitchat, but the kind that aims to get to the bottom of things. I call this an “art” because it requires both tact and doggedness. And I call it a moral accomplishment because to be good at this kind of conversation you have to love the truth more than you love your own current state of understanding. This is, of course, an unusual priority to have, which may help to account for the rarity of real mastery in any pursuit. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1026))
- Isn’t it true in general that life is shot through with hidden contingencies? Risk is present in any activity that is directed to some goal—the risk of failure. Unlike animals that live in the moment, guided by instinct, we are constantly monitoring our own performance, second-guessing it, tuning it up. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1037))
- What it means to be erotic is that we are never fully at home in the world. We are always “on our way.” Or perhaps we should say that this state of being on our way to somewhere else is our peculiar human way of being here in the world. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1092))
- How we act is not determined in an isolated moment of choice; it is powerfully ordered by how we perceive the situation, how we are attuned to it, and this is very much a function of our previous history of shaping ourselves to the world in a particular way. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1221))
- The basic design intention guiding Mercedes in the last ten years seems to be that its cars should offer psychic blow jobs to the affluent. ([Location 1277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1277))
- The world is its own best model. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1338))
- When the axis of closer-to-me and farther-from-me is collapsed, I can be anywhere, and find that I am rarely in any place in particular. To be present with those I share a life with is then one option among many, and likely not the most amusing one at any given moment. ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1403))
- Natasha Dow Schüll in her deeply disturbing book Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas. ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1427))
- Schüll in fact notes parallels to children’s electronic games, and draws on studies of these that explore a certain paradox. The appeal of the games is that they give the player a sense of control. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1432))
- Your action of pressing a button produces an effect that aligns perfectly with your will, because your will has been channeled into the spare, binary affordances provided by the buttons: press or don’t press. ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1446))
- You give yourself over to the logic of the machine and are rewarded by a feeling of efficacy. That is, you lose yourself, and thereby gain control. ([Location 1447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1447))
- You are neither learning something about the world, as the blind man does with his cane, nor acquiring something that could properly be called a skill. Rather, you are acting within the perception-action circuits encoded in the narrow affordances of the game, learned in a few trials. This is a kind of autistic pseudo-action, based on exact repetition, and the feeling of efficacy that it offers evidently holds great appeal. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1455))
- As the world becomes more confusing, seemingly controlled by vast impersonal forces (e.g., “globalization” or “collateralized debt obligations”) that no single individual can fully bring within view; as the normative expectation becomes to land a cubicle job, in which the chain of cause and effect can be quite dispersed and opaque; as home life becomes deskilled (we outsource our cooking to corporations, our house repairs to immigrant guest workers); as the material basis of modern life becomes ever more obscured, and the occasions for skillful action are removed to sites overseas, where things are made; to sites nearby but socially invisible, where things are tended and repaired; and to sites unknown, where elites orchestrate commercial and political forces—when all of this is the case, the experience of individual agency becomes somewhat elusive. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1482))
- We therefore seek out other, personal technologies that can give us safe haven: “manufactured certainties,” as Schüll puts it, that help us “manage [our] affective states.” That is what computer games seem to do for our quasi-autistic cohort of young men; it is what machine gambling does for those who have gone down that particular path. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1499))
- The pleasure principle—the drive to gratify desire and avoid pain—keeps us in perpetual motion. ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1676))
- the proof is the zero at the end.” ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1683))
- As someone who is self-employed, I don’t have the jig of a regular job, so the disposition of every hour is a matter of choice, an occasion for reflection and evaluation. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1702))
- The point of the activity is the activity itself. ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1707))
- There is nothing infantile about good art, but it does show us the world as viewed by a consciousness that has, for a spell, liberated itself from conventionality. ([Location 2261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=2261))
- “Self-knowledge is a kind of funny thing because the less of it you have, the more you think you have.” ([Location 2358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=2358))
- The Hegelian suggestion seems true to me—namely, that it is in the confrontation between the self and the world beyond one’s head that one acquires a sharpened picture of each, under the sign of responsibility. ([Location 2408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=2408))
- Work, then, is a mode of acting in the world that carries the possibility of justification through pay. ([Location 2418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=2418))
- Competence rests on an apprehension of real features of the world, as refracted through some set of human needs/desires and corresponding technologies. ([Location 2464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=2464))
- The project of becoming a grown-up demands that one bring one’s conflicts to awareness; to intellectualize them and become articulate about them, rather than let them drive one’s behavior stupidly. Being an adult involves learning to accept limits imposed by a world that doesn’t fully answer to our needs; to fail at this is to remain infantile, growing old in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.
