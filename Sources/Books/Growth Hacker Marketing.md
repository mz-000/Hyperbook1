## Highlights
- The end goal of every growth hacker is to build a self-perpetuating marketing machine that reaches millions by itself. ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPDR3JM&location=94))
- One is growth hacking; the other, simply guessing. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPDR3JM&location=251))
- In other words: everything is now on the table. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPDR3JM&location=258))
- Because once you get there, your marketing efforts become like a spark applied to a bed of kindling soaked in kerosene. The old way? It’s striking a match . . . and hoping it starts a fire somewhere. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPDR3JM&location=274))
- We must simply and repeatedly question every assumption. Who is this product for? Why would they use it? Why do I use it? ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPDR3JM&location=279))
- If you want to go viral, it must be baked into your product. There must be a reason to share it and the means to do so. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPDR3JM&location=467))
- Instead, it should invest in refining and improving the service itself until users are so happy that they can’t stop using the service ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPDR3JM&location=514))
- they merged marketing into their product development; they kicked off growth with early adopters; they added viral elements; and then they relentlessly repeated these cycles, always guided by the data, with an eye toward optimization.
