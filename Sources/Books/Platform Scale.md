We are no longer in the business of building software. We are increasingly moving into the business of enabling efficient social and business interactions, mediated by software.

On platforms, the business does not create the end value; rather, the business only enables value creation. As a result, participants on the platform take on production as well as consumption roles.

Platform scale (n): Business scale powered by the ability to leverage and orchestrate a global connected ecosystem of producers and consumers toward efficient value creation and exchange. The management of platform scale involves the design and optimization of value-exchange interactions between producers and consumers.

Unlike hotels, which invest in resource creation, platforms like Airbnb invest in creating better trust mechanisms that identify and differentiate good behavior from poor behavior and minimize interaction risks.

Platforms enable value creation and exchange by matching the most relevant resources from producers in the ecosystem with the consumers on the platform that need those resources.

These businesses create a plug-and-play infrastructure that enables producers and consumers of value to connect and interact with each other in a manner that wasnâ€™t possible in the past.

Platforms successfully orchestrate value-exchanging interactions in this ecosystem using data about the various ecosystem participants. Ecosystems are the key enablers of value creation on platforms and a new source of competitive advantage. Platform giants will create massive value, not through their access to physical resources but through leveraging data to orchestrate physical and digital resources across their ecosystem.

Pipe scale (n): Business scale powered by the ability to coordinate internal labor and resources toward efficient value creation and toward delivery of the created value to an aggregated consumer base. The management of pipe scale involves the design and optimization of this linear flow of value from the business to the consumer.

We are not in the business of building software, We are in the business of enabling interactions.

Platforms allow participants to co-create and exchange value with each other.
