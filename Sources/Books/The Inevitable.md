## Highlights
- In the three decades since then, this technological convergence between communication and computation has spread, sped up, blossomed, and evolved. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=53))
- Banning the inevitable usually backfires. Prohibition is at best temporary, and in the long counterproductive. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=96))
- Because of technology everything we make is always in the process of becoming. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=111))
- benefits. A shoe, too, is no longer a finished product, but an endless process of reimagining our extended feet, perhaps with disposable covers, sandals that morph as you walk, treads that shift, or floors that act as shoes. “Shoeing” becomes a service and not a noun. In the intangible digital realm, nothing is static or fixed. Everything is becoming. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=123))
- we can get the most from the technologies when we “listen” to the direction the technologies lean, and bend our expectations, regulations, and products to these fundamental tendencies within that technology. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=138))
- 1 BECOMING ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=154))
- In this era of “becoming,” everyone becomes a newbie. Worse, we will be newbies forever. That should keep us humble. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=179))
- All of us—every one of us—will be endless newbies in the future simply trying to keep up. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=180))
- However, neither dystopia nor utopia is our destination. Rather, technology is taking us to protopia. More accurately, we have already arrived in protopia. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=213))
- Protopia is a state of becoming, rather than a destination. It is a process. In the protopian mode, things are better today than they were yesterday, although only a little better. It is incremental improvement or mild progress. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=214))
- The “pro” in protopian stems from the notions of process and progress. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=216))
- The accretion of tiny marvels can numb us to the arrival of the stupendous. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=320))
- 2 COGNIFYING ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=431))
- It is hard to imagine anything that would “change everything” as much as cheap, powerful, ubiquitous artificial intelligence. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=433))
- The arrival of artificial thinking accelerates all the other disruptions I describe in this book; it is the ur-force in our future. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=451))
- The AI on the horizon looks more like Amazon Web Services—cheap, reliable, industrial-grade digital smartness running behind everything, and almost invisible except when it blinks off. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=490))
- This common utility will serve you as much IQ as you want but no more than you need. You’ll simply plug into the grid and get AI as if it was electricity. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=491))
- Cognified construction—Imagine project management software that is smart enough to take into account weather forecasts, port traffic delays, currency exchange rates, accidents, in addition to design changes. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=535))
- Cognified toys—Toys more like pets. Furbies were primitive compared with the intense attraction that a smart petlike toy will invoke from children. Toys that can converse are lovable. Dolls may be the first really popular robots. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=540))
- Rather than use AI to make its search better, Google is using search to make its AI better. Every time you type a query, click on a search-generated link, or create a link on the web, you are training the Google AI. When you type “Easter Bunny” into the image search bar and then click on the most Easter Bunny–looking image, you are teaching the AI what an Easter Bunny looks like. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=555))
- “AI is akin to building a rocket ship. You need a huge engine and a lot of fuel. The rocket engine is the learning algorithms but the fuel is the huge amounts of data we can feed to these algorithms.” ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=587))
- Now called freestyle chess matches, these are like mixed martial arts fights, where players use whatever combat techniques they want. You can play as your unassisted human self, or you can act as the hand for your supersmart chess computer, merely moving its board pieces, or you can play as a “centaur,” which is the human/AI cyborg that Kasparov advocated. A centaur player will listen to the moves suggested by the AI but will occasionally override them—much the way we use the GPS navigation intelligence in our cars. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=614))
- In the championship Freestyle Battle 2014, open to all modes of players, pure chess AI engines won 42 games, but centaurs won 53 games. Today the best chess player alive is a centaur. It goes by the name of Intagrand, a team of several humans and several different chess programs. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=618))
- But here’s the even more surprising part: The advent of AI didn’t diminish the performance of purely human chess players. Quite the opposite. Cheap, supersmart chess programs inspired more people than ever to play chess, at more tournaments than ever, and the players got better than ever. There are more than twice as many grand masters now as there were when Deep Blue first beat Kasparov. The top-ranked human chess player today, Magnus Carlsen, trained with AIs and has been deemed the most computerlike of all human chess players. He also has the highest human grand master rating of all time. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=620))
- The AI that will diagnose your illness will be significantly different from the artificial smartness that oversees your house. The superbrain that predicts the weather accurately will be in a completely different kingdom of mind from the intelligence woven into your clothes. The taxonomy of minds must reflect the different ways in which minds are engineered with these trade-offs. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=669))
- AI could just as well stand for “alien intelligence.” We have no certainty we’ll contact extraterrestrial beings from one of the billion earthlike planets in the sky in the next 200 years, but we have almost 100 percent certainty that we’ll manufacture an alien intelligence by then. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=718))
- They will force us to reevaluate our roles, our beliefs, our goals, our identity. What are humans for? ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=720))
- The alienness of artificial intelligence will become more valuable to us than its speed or power. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=725))
- The greatest benefit of the arrival of artificial intelligence is that AIs will help define humanity. We need AIs to tell us who we are. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=737))
- Two hundred years ago, 70 percent of American workers lived on the farm. Today automation has eliminated all but 1 percent of their jobs, replacing them (and their work animals) with machines. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=744))
- The rote tasks of any information-intensive job can be automated. It doesn’t matter if you are a doctor, translator, editor, lawyer, architect, reporter, or even programmer: The robot takeover will be epic. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=769))
- Nearby will be cheap. So we’ll get this network of locally franchised factories, where most things will be made within five miles of where they are needed.” ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=803))
- 1. Jobs Humans Can Do but Robots Can Do Even Better ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=811))
- 2. Jobs Humans Can’t Do but Robots Can ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=822))
- 3. Jobs We Didn’t Know We Wanted Done ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=833))
- 4. Jobs Only Humans Can Do—at First ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=851))
- This is not a race against the machines. If we race against them, we lose. This is a race with the machines. You’ll be paid in the future based on how well you work with robots. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=895))
- 3 FLOWING ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=904))
- As Marshall McLuhan observed, the first version of a new medium imitates the medium it replaces. The first commercial computers employed the metaphor of the office. Our screens had a “desktop” and “folders” and “files.” They were hierarchically ordered, like much of the industrial age that the computer was overthrowing. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=932))
- The second digital age overturned the office metaphor and brought us the organizing principle of the web. The basic unit was no longer files but “pages.” Pages were not organized into folders, but were arranged into a networked web. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=934))
- Now we are transitioning into the third age of computation. Pages and browsers are far less important. Today the prime units are flows and streams. We constantly monitor Twitter streams and the flows of posts on our Facebook wall. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=937))
- This inevitable shift toward fluidity is now transforming almost every other aspect of society. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=977))
- I call these qualities “generatives.” A generative value is a quality or attribute that must be generated at the time of the transaction. A generative thing cannot be copied, cloned, stored, and warehoused. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1005))
- Here are eight generatives that are “better than free.” IMMEDIACY ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1008))
- Sooner or later you can find a free copy of whatever you want, but getting a copy delivered to your inbox the moment it is released—or even better, produced—by its creators is a generative asset. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1009))
- Beta versions of apps or software were once devalued because they are incomplete, but we’ve come to understand that beta versions also possess immediacy, which is valuable. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1014))
- PERSONALIZATION A generic version of a concert recording may be free, but if you want a copy that has been tweaked to sound acoustically perfect in your particular living room—as if it were being performed in your room—you may be willing to pay a lot. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1016))
- INTERPRETATION As the old joke goes: “Software, free. User manual, $10,000.” ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1025))
- AUTHENTICITY ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1032))
- Artists have dealt with this problem for a long time. Graphic reproductions such as photographs and lithographs often come with the artist’s stamp of authenticity—a signature—to raise the price of the copy. Digital ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1037))
- ACCESSIBILITY ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1040))
- Many people, myself included, will be happy to have others tend our “possessions” while we lazily subscribe to them on the cloud. I may own a book or have previously paid for music I treasure, but I’ll pay Acme Digital Warehouse to serve me what I want when and how I want it. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1042))
- With a paid service I have access to free material anywhere, channeled to any of my many devices, with a super user interface. In part, this is what you get with iTunes on the cloud. You pay for conveniently accessible music you could download for free somewhere else. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1044))
- EMBODIMENT ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1048))
- And nothing gets embodied as much as music in a live performance, with real bodies. In this accounting, the music is free, the bodily performance expensive. Indeed, many bands today earn their living through concerts, not music sales. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1053))
- Live concert tours, live TED talks, live radio shows, pop-up food tours all speak to the power and value of a paid ephemeral embodiment of something you could download for free. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1056))
- PATRONAGE ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1057))
- Deep down, avid audiences and fans want to pay creators. Fans love to reward artists, musicians, authors, actors, and other creators with the tokens of their appreciation, because it allows them to connect with people they admire. But they will pay only under four conditions that are not often met: 1) It must be extremely easy to do; 2) The amount must be reasonable; 3) There’s clear benefit to them for paying; and 4) It’s clear the money will directly benefit the creators. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1058))
- DISCOVERABILITY The previous generatives resided within creative works. Discoverability, however, is an asset that applies to an aggregate of many works. No matter what its price, a work has no value unless it is seen. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1067))
- TV Guide allegedly made more money than all three major TV networks it “guided” combined. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1074))
- They may be free somewhere else, but they are essentially lost and buried. In these examples, you are not paying for the copies, you are paying for the findability. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1078))
- These eight qualities require a new skill set for creators. Success no longer derives from mastering distribution. Distribution is nearly automatic; it’s all streams. ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1080))
- These are the Four Stages of Flowing: 1. Fixed. Rare. The starting norm is precious products that take much expertise to create. Each is an artisan work, complete and able to stand alone, sold in high-quality reproductions to compensate the creators. 2. Free. Ubiquitous. The first disruption is promiscuous copying of the product, duplicated so relentlessly that it becomes a commodity. Cheap, perfect copies are spent freely, dispersed anywhere there is demand. This extravagant dissemination of copies shatters the established economics. 3. Flowing. Sharing. The second disruption is an unbundling of the product into parts, each element flowing to find its own new uses and to be remixed into new bundles. The product is now a stream of services issuing from the shared cloud. It becomes a platform for wealth and innovation. 4. Opening. Becoming. The third disruption is enabled by the previous two. Streams of powerful services and ready pieces, conveniently grabbed at little cost, enable amateurs with little expertise to create new products and brand-new categories of products. The status of creation is inverted, so that the audience is now the artist. Output, selection, and quality skyrocket. ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1189))
- Mass-produced books changed the way people thought. The technology of printing expanded the number of words available, from about 50,000 words in Old English to a million today. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1240))
- More word choices enlarged what could be communicated. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1241))
- The country’s success depended on high levels of literacy, a robust free press, allegiance to the rule of law (found in books), and a common language across a continent. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1250))
- People of the Book favor solutions by laws, while People of the Screen favor technology as a solution to all problems. ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1284))
- We should properly call this new activity “screening” rather than reading. Screening includes reading words, but also watching words and reading images. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1300))
- This new activity has new characteristics. Screens are always on; we never stop staring at them, unlike with books. This new platform is very visual and it gradually merges words with moving images. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1301))
- A book is less an artifact and more a stream that flows into your view. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1351))
- Wikipedia is the first networked book. In the goodness of time, each Wikipedia page will become saturated with blue links as every statement is cross-referenced. ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1394))
- In the goodness of time, as all books become fully digital, every one of them will accumulate the equivalent of blue underlined passages as each literary reference is networked within that book out to all other books. ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1395))
- Over the next three decades, scholars and fans, aided by computational algorithms, will knit together the books of the world into a single networked literature. A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or a timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1449))
- We’ll come to understand that no work, no idea stands alone, but that all good, true, and beautiful things are ecosystems of intertwined parts and related entities, past and present. ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1451))
- Third, the universal networked library of all books will cultivate a new sense of authority. If you can truly incorporate all texts—past and present in all languages—on a particular subject, then you can have a clearer sense of what we as a civilization, a species, do and don’t know. The empty white spaces of our collective ignorance are highlighted, while the golden peaks of our knowledge are drawn with completeness. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1479))
- 5 ACCESSING ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1589))
- Possession is not as important as it once was. Accessing is more important than ever. ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1597))
- Pretend you live inside the world’s largest rental store. Why would you own anything? You can borrow whatever you need within arm’s reach. Instant borrowing gives you most of the benefits of owning and few of its disadvantages. You have no responsibility to clean, to repair, to store, to sort, to insure, to upgrade, to maintain. What if this rental store were a magical cupboard, a kind of Mary Poppins carpetbag, where an endless selection of gear was crammed into a bottomless container? All you have to do is knock on the outside and summon an item, and abracadabra—there it is. ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1597))
- Dematerialization ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1606))
- On average most modern products have undergone dematerialization. Since the 1970s, the weight of the average automobile has fallen by 25 percent. Appliances tend to weigh less per function. Of course, communication technology shows the clearest dematerialization. ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1612))
- The ratio of mass needed to generate a unit of GDP has been falling for 150 years, declining even faster in the last two decades. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1618))
- do. Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software. Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if they were intangible services. ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1624))
- The switch from “ownership that you purchase” to “access that you subscribe to” overturns many conventions. Ownership is casual, fickle. If something better comes along, grab it. A subscription, on the other hand, gushes a never-ending stream of updates, issues, and versions that force a constant interaction between the producer and the consumer. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1640))
- Real-Time On Demand Access is also a way to deliver new things in close to real time. Unless something runs in real time, it does not count. ([Location 1665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1665))
- In the past few years thousands of entrepreneurs seeking funding have pitched venture capitalists for an “Uber for X,” where X is any business where customers still have to wait. ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1675))
- Our appetite for the instant is insatiable. The cost of real-time engagement requires massive coordination and degrees of collaboration that were unthinkable a few years ago. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1708))
- And for many of the things we will use in the upcoming world, short-term use will be the norm. As more items are invented and manufactured—while the total number of hours in a day to enjoy them remains fixed—we spend less and less time per item. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1719))
- other words, the long-term trend in our modern lives is that most goods and services will be short-term use. Therefore most goods and services are candidates for rental and sharing. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1721))
- For better or worse, our lives are accelerating, and the only speed fast enough is instant. The speed of electrons will be the speed of the future. Deliberate vacations from this speed will remain a choice, but on average communication technology is biased toward moving everything to on demand. And on demand is biased toward access over ownership. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1729))
- Decentralization We are at the midpoint in a hundred-year scramble toward greater decentralization. The glue that holds together institutions and processes as they undergo massive decentering is cheap, ubiquitous communication. Without the ability to remain connected as things spread wide into networks, firms would collapse. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1732))
- The consequence of moving away from centralized organization to the flatter worlds of networks is that everything—both tangible and intangible—must flow faster to keep the whole going together. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1738))
- Nearly every aspect of modern civilization has been flattening down except one: money. Minting money is one of the last jobs left for a central government that most political parties agree is legitimate. ([Location 1740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016JPTOUG&location=1740))
