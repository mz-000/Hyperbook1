## Highlights

    - Note: personal team client
- Like most other events that change the world, it didn't seem interesting to anyone except the people willing to do the work. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=703))
- There is no actual work being done. Instead it's all metawork, or discussions about future work. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1120))
- It's a sea of abstraction. The nonmakers are in charge of the makers and insist on spending the off-site not making anything. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1121))
- matter where they go, they take dozens of forgotten assumptions about how work is done along with them. The more an event is driven by the people in power, the more it will reinforce the status quo. This is why these big meetings start with promises of growth and innovation and end with a vague sense of disappointment. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1130))
- The burden of deciding when to launch something is on the maker, not a marketer. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1143))
- The general work flow at Automattic had seven steps: ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1151))
- The fundamental mistake companies that talk about innovation make is keeping barriers to entry high. They make it hard to even try out ideas, blind to how much experimentation you need to sort the good ideas from the bad. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1181))
- The only way you learn is by doing things where you don't know the outcome. ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1304))
- the best way to learn is to do—to think (but not for too long), make decisions, learn from what happens, and repeat. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1406))
- studying Krav Maga, ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1640))
- I believe I can manage anyone making anything provided two things are true: clarity and trust. If there is clarity between us on the goal and how we'll know when we're done, then we can speak the same language about what we need to do to get there. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1673))
- Many teams have leaders who've never experienced clarity in their entire lives: they don't know what to look for, much less what to do when they find it. Thinking clearly, as trite as it sounds, was my strength. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1677))
- Even programmers who are good at this often dislike it. Being a good lead is all about switching hats: knowing which level of abstraction to work at to solve a problem. It's rarely a question of intelligence; instead, it's picking the right perspective to use on a particular challenge. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1702))
- Patience is a manifestation of trust. It conveys to the other person that he or she is worth the time. ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1706))
- Similar truths are discovered by breaking rules: you need to break some to learn which are just for show and which ones matter. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1716))
- How and where do issues get reported? Who responds? How long does it take? Who decides what issues are worked on first (triage)? Who decides how the thing will be fixed? Who does the actual work? Who checks to make sure it was done properly? ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1731))
- I tried to remember Mullenweg's attitude of letting that which did not matter, not matter. ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1772))
- Defensive management is blind to recognizing how obsessing about preventing bad things also prevents good things from happening or sometimes even prevents anything from happening at all. ([Location 1917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1917))
- safeguards don't make you safe; they make you lazy. ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=1953))
- The only sane way to work is to let the project define the plan. Only a fool chooses tools before studying the job to be done. ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=2361))
- benevolent dictator, ([Location 2486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=2486))
- If you want longevity, you can't just bet on tradition; ([Location 2599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=2599))
- To leave Automattic means either returning to self-employment or relocation, things they took the job at Automattic to avoid. ([Location 3278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=3278))
- We all imagine an angel will fly down from the sky and let us know it's time to make that change we've had on our minds for far too long. ([Location 3723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=3723))
- they have answered many important questions the working world is afraid even to ask. ([Location 3800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DVJXI4M&location=3800))
