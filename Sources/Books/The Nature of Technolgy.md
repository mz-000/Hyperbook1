This is a general rule: what starts as a series of parts loosely strung together, if used heavily enough, congeals into a self-contained unit. The modules of technology over time become standardized units.

Technology builds out not just from combination of what exists already but from the constant capturing and harnessing of natural phenomena.

Phenomena are simply natural effects, and as such they exist independently of humans and of technology. They have no “use” attached to them. A principle by contrast is the idea of use of a phenomenon for some purpose and it exists very much in the world of humans and of use.

Technologies somehow must come into being as fresh combinations of what already exists.

The other is the process by which all objects of some class are related by ties of common descent from the collection of earlier objects. This is evolution in its full sense, and it is what I will mean by evolution.

Our deepest hope as humans lies in technology; but our deepest trust lies in nature.

Technologies in other words consisted of other technologies, they arose as combinations of other technologies.

The change in vision I am proposing, from seeing technologies as stand-alone objects each with a fixed purpose to seeing them as objects that can be formed into endless new combinations, is not just abstract. It is mirrored in a broad shift in the character of technology currently taking place.

Novel technologies must somehow arise by combination of existing technologies.

The first and most basic one is that a technology is a means to fulfill a human purpose.
