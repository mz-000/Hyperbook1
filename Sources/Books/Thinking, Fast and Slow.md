- Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=244))
- when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=263))
