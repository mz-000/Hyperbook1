The Theses

Remember that the purpose of a thesis is to start a discussion. A thesis is not a conclusion, or a conviction, but an assertion that’s designed to get people talking. It may be right or wrong. In fact sometimes wrong theses are the most productive.

If a Thesis is a clickable link, then it will open an explanatory page. Eventually all theses will have such pages.
