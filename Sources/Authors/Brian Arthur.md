Brian Arthur is known for 3 main sets of ideas:

[Increasing returns.](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/increasingreturns.htm) In the 1980s Arthur developed a way for economics to understand how increasing returns or positive feedbacks (e.g. network effects) operate in the economy — in particular how they can magnify small, random events and act to lock in dominant players. This work has gone on to become important to our [understanding of the high-tech economy.](https://www.fastcompany.com/3064681/most-important-economic-theory-in-technology-brian-arthur)

[Complexity economics.](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/complexityeconomics.htm) In the late 1980s, Arthur led a group at the Santa Fe Institute to develop an alternative approach to economics—"[[Complexity]] economics." Standard economics is based on the idea of super-rational actors operating in a static equilibrium world; complexity economics assumes actors in the economy do not necessarily face well-defined problems or use super-rationality. They explore, try to make sense, react and re-react to the outcomes they together create. The economy is not in stasis but always forming, always "discovering" fresh novelty. In this non-equilibrium view of the economy, bubbles and crashes can happen, markets can be "gamed" or exploited, and history and institutions matter.

[How technology evolves.](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/thenatureoftechnology.htm) In 2009, Arthur published _The Nature of Technology: What it Is and How it Evolves._ The book is a theory of evolution for technology. It argues that technology, like biological life, evolves from earlier forms. But the main mechanism isn't Darwin's, it is the combining of earlier technologies—earlier forms—to make new technologies. The book explores in detail how this evolution works. And it argues that economy isn't just a container for its technologies; the economy emerges from its technologies.

Dave Bakker on Git:


Hi! I’ve looked into the git plugin of obsidian but found it not very userfriendly. I’m using Sourcetree which has a great UI and is very simple to use. That’s where you would see changes, can commit them and push them to the master repository.How I set up the vault is by creating a bitbucket repo and cloning that to my local system (so it’s visible as a folder), but it’s possible to create an external (cloud) repo from Sourcetree itself as well and that way it’s even easier. Bitbucket has a great FAQ/forum/community so I could find all the answers there.The shared environment works basically by giving people access to your repo/vault by using SSH keys (which is the safest, alternatively just an url and password would work too). Each person then needs to clone the master repo to their local system. They can then work locally and commit changes/push them to the master. You would then see those commits in your Sourcetree and can approve or reject and so on. So ypu’d have commits from multiple people, and ypu could see if they would conflict.

If you go further, people can create a ‘branche’ to work on, which starts with the exact copy of your master, but then people can change it to their liking, until the moment they are finished and can merge that ‘branche’ back into the original. This would maybe create conflicts, but if it is a separate chapter for example it will be fine. The benefit of this approach is that multiple changes are combined together. But this scenario takes a bit more thinking I guess.
