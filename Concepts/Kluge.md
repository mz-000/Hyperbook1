2. n. A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves [_ad-hockery_](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/ad-hockery.html) and verges on being a [_crock_](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/crock.html).

4. vt. To insert a kluge into a program. “I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way.”
