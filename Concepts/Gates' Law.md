> “The speed of software halves every 18 months.”

This oft-cited law is an ironic comment on the tendency of software bloat to outpace the every-18-month doubling in hardware capacity per dollar predicted by [_Moore's Law_](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/Moores-Law.html). The reference is to Bill Gates; Microsoft is widely considered among the worst if not the worst of the perpetrators of bloat.
