# Bus Factor


The **bus factor** is a measurement of the [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk "Risk") resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members, derived from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus." It is also known as the **bread truck scenario**, **bus problem**, **beer truck scenario**, **lottery factor**, **truck factor**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor#cite_note-1) **bus/truck number**, or **lorry factor**.

In many software development projects, one goal is to share information in order to increase the bus factor to potentially the size of the entire team. A high bus factor is considered a good thing as it means that many individuals know enough to carry on and the project could still succeed even in very adverse events.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor#cite_note-12)

Several ways to increase the bus factor have been proposed:

-   Reduce [[Complexity]].
-   Document all processes and keep that documentation up-to-date,


[[Technology Design]]
