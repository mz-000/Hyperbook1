# The Spotify Model

[The Spotify Model on Spotify Labs](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)

The Spotify Model is an approach to team and organisation structure which has been popularised by 'Spotify'. In this model, teams are organised around features, rather than technologies.

The Spotify Model also popularises the concepts of Tribes, Guilds, Chapters, which are other components of their organisation structure.

Members of the organisation have described that the actual meaning of these groups changes, evolves and is an on-going experiment. The fact that the model is a _process in motion_, rather than a fixed model continues to lead to varying interpretations of the structure, which may be based on presentations given by employees at conferences. This means 'snapshots' may be 're-packaged' by third parties as a _fixed structure_, with the fact that the model is dynamic being lost.
