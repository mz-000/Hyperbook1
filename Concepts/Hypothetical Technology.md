# Hypothetical Technology


**Hypothetical technologies** are technologies that do not exist yet, but that could exist in the future.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hypothetical_technologies#cite_note-1) They are distinct from [emerging technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies "List of emerging technologies"), which have achieved some developmental success. Emerging technologies as of 2018 include 3-D metal printing and artificial embryos.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hypothetical_technologies#cite_note-2) Many hypothetical technologies have been the subject of [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction").

The criteria for this list are that the technology:

1.  Must not exist yet
2.  If the technology does not have an existing article (i.e. it is "redlinked"), a reference must be provided for it.
