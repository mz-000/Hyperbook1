#Concepts 
**bikeshedding**

Technical disputes over minor, marginal issues conducted while more serious ones are being overlooked. The implied image is of people arguing over what color to paint the bicycle shed while the house is not finished.

To _bikeshed_ is to devote way too much time and energy working on and optimizing trivial issues — that are often hypothetical future problems that don’t exist yet — instead of focusing on what’s actually important right now.

## Backstory

The term comes from a story in which a group of engineers, architects, and scientists are hired to build a nuclear power plant, but get stuck deciding where and how to build the staff bike shed. Where will the bikes go? How many bikes should it be able to hold? What color should the bike shed be painted? All of this attention on the employee bike shed results in a loss of funding and neither the bike shed nor the power plant being built. This is also known as “[The Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality)”, that is, that people will give disproportionate weight to trivial matters. Or…bikeshedding for short!

## **Usage Example**

Say that you’re launching your product in just under a month. You’re in a meeting with all your colleagues, trying to plan the next three weeks of work. There’s a lot of important things to do, the product doesn’t even work yet! Yet, everyone is arguing over how to write documentation: should we use JS Docs? Dropbox Paper? Concourse? Many engineers spend precious time creating new docs and wikis on their favorite platforms. You might say “Y’all, Let’s put this issue to rest. It doesn’t matter at this point, just pick one! We’re _bikeshedding_ right now”.
