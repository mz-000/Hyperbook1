# Ninety-Ninety Rule

> The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time.
> The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.

Attributed to Tom Cargill of Bell Labs, and popularized by Jon Bentley's September 1985 _Bumper-Sticker Computer Science_ column in _Communications of the ACM_. It was there called the “Rule of Credibility”, a name which seems not to have stuck. Other maxims in the same vein include the law attributed to the early British computer scientist Douglas Hartree: “The time from now until the completion of the project tends to become constant.”
