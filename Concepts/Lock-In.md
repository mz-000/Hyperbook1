# Lock-In
> Technological lock-in is the idea that the more a society adopts a certain technology, the more unlikely users are to switch.


In economics, vendor lock-in, also known as proprietary lock-in or customer lock-in, makes a customer dependent on a vendor for products and services, unable to use another vendor without substantial switching costs. Lock-in costs that create barriers to market entry may result in antitrust action against a monopoly.
