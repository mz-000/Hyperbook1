> The technical boundaries of a system will reflect the structure of the organization.

This law suggests that the technical boundaries of a system will reflect the structure of the organization. It is commonly referred to when looking at organization improvements, Conway's Law suggests that if an organization is structured into many small, disconnected units, the software it produces will be. If an organization is built more around 'verticals' which are orientated around features or services, the software systems will also reflect this.
