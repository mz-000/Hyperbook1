## Human

**Creative  
Adaptive  
Intuitive**

Individual strengths of a human chess players:

-   being able to construct meaningful strategic plans, taking into account the long-term quality of moves, which even the fastest PCs cannot foresee;
-   being able to discriminate meaningful moves from the meaningless, without wasting time on deeply calculating the combinations which can be deemed meaningless at first sight;
-   being able to critically judge and analyze a chess game, plan, opening or endgame.

## Machine

**Consistent  
Objective  
Precise**

Individual strengths of a computer chess program:

-   being able to calculate at a fascinating speed - on an average PC of today, a chess program is able to calculate a few millions of positions per second, making it tactically superior to any human in complex tactical positions;
-   having access to a database of millions of tried and thoroughly tested opening moves and variations, with the ability to retrieve information from such a database very quickly, and to store such a database on hardware resources available to most modern PCs;

## Centaur Characteristics

_(of advanced chess in particular, but centaurs in general)_

-   _increasing the level of play to heights never before seen in chess;_
    
-   _producing blunder-free games with the qualities and the beauty of both perfect tactical play and highly meaningful strategic plans;_
    
-   _giving the viewing audience a remarkable insight into the thought processes of strong human chess players and strong computers, and the combination thereof._

**New York City, May 1997**

  
Sixth and final game in the rematch between world chess champion Garry Kasparov and IBM supercomputer Deep Blue.

[Forbes.com](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/davidewalt/files/2011/08/kasparov-deep-blue-game-6-1997.jpg)

Deep Blue famously wins the game, the first time where a computer outplays a chess grandmaster.

**Leon, June 1998**

The world's first championship of advanced chess organized by Kasparov.

In advanced (alt: _freestyle_ or _centaur_) chess, humans of any expert level play assisted by technology such as hardware, software and databases.

Over the following year, a community of advanced chess players develops, designing various approaches of combining intelligence for chess playing mastery.

Having evolved their methods, centaur players regularly start out-playing both chess grandmasters and supercomputers in 2005.

Teams today win by combining _average_ skill players, _mid-range_ technology and _strong_ interfaces. By optimizing for an efficient connection between human and machine, teams can better leverage the characteristics of either.

## Evidence against Centaur Chess superiority

_Some argue that freestyle chess players had a window of success against machine players, and that AI has generally caught up with human chess players._
