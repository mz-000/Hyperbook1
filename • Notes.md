# Notes

## CONCEPTS:
- Affordability Principle / Abundance 
- "tech is a trait" (Francesco Fernando “Philosphical Posthumanism” 2019)
- Constraints → Infinite
- "How we use tech is unpredictable"
- "Deterministic / Instrumentalist" (We think we have control of the process.)
- Implicit Separation
	- between tech and human
	- "what is the human essence"
	- is tech an enhancement?
	- we are intertwined.
- Ceiling: the best tech available is available to everyone
- Massive Transformational Goal (SU)



## NOTES (JK): 
- Kodak - simple example…
- A timeline of how quick we went from mainframe as the concepts of exponential are important ipo. At least a base understanding. 
- How utilities and public services enable ways of life never imaginable before (water, trains, power ect) 
- Generational changes 
- Base human desires and hierarchy of needs - how technology can do crazy things with this.
